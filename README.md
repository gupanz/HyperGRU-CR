# HyperGRU-CR
This is the official implementation of our work: Modeling Multi-behavior Sequence via HyperGRU Contrastive Network for Micro-video
Recommendation. The code is tested under a Linux desktop with TensorFlow 1.13.1 and Python 3.6.2.
The project can be run by three steps:
1. downlod the KuaiRec dataset: https://kuairec.com/
2. preprocess the dataset using "kuairec preprocessing.ipynb"
3. set the data path in file "config.py", then run the project by "sh run.sh".
